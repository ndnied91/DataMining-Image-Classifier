# DataMining-Image-Classifier

This is an image classifer that was created for a Data Mining class. It uses Tensorflow to learn and then recognize certain images.

This model is built from images of cats, dogs, beaches, mountains, and buildings and 150-200 picture of each was used to train the model. This modal is accurate granted a photo is given from the five training sets. Scaling up and provding the modal with a bigger sample set would increaase the accuracy. Increasing the number of training steps would also improve the accuracy.
